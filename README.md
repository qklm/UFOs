# Overview
We have codified a small list of ufo sightings from a 4 day period across many states of the US.

## Results
Simply type your query into the search box, and the resulting table will show what events occured within the given parameters.

## Summary
Drawback: Narrow scope, and only have instances available from the US over a short window of time. Datetime coding is also anything but uniform.
Further development: create an entry form to update the list as visitors find the site. standardize time format, and what constitutes as a shape. add a sound column
